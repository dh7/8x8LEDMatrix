============
This is a Fork from thiseldo/8x8LEDMatrix

These are a collection of sketches for use with the Ciseco LED Matrix shield.

I bought mine on seemageek.

This may work with other similar shields providing the pin mappings are correct,

All examples work with Arduino 1.0 and higher only.
No dependency
